# Twitter--Classification

My goal was to solve real-life problems. Therefore, I aimed to create a model to understand which user would appeal more to companies while they advertise. This model would enable small businesses or individuals who want to address a specific group to advertise more cheaply using only one Twitter account. However, I couldn't complete the project. The reason for this was that the model was outdated and couldn't classify groups correctly. Nevertheless, I had the opportunity to learn how to clean very messy data such as Twitter data and create a classification model using Spark. The project was not completed, but it taught me a lot.
